NAME
    Crypt::GOST - The GOST Encryption Algorithm

SYNOPSIS
    use Crypt::GOST;

    $cipher = Crypt::GOST->new($key);

    $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);

    $plaintext = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

DESCRIPTION
    GOST 28147-89 is a 64-bit symmetric block cipher with a 256-bit
    key developed in the former Soviet Union. Some information on it
    is available at <URL:http://vipul.net/gost/>.

    This module implements GOST encryption. It supports the Crypt::CBC
    interface, with the functions described below. It also provides
    an interface that is backwards- compatible with Crypt::GOST 0.41,
    but its use in new code is discouraged.

  Functions

    blocksize
        Returns the size (in bytes) of the block (8, in this case).

    keysize
        Returns the size (in bytes) of the key (32, in this case).

    new($key)
        This creates a new Crypt::GOST object with the specified key.

    encrypt($data)
        Encrypts blocksize() bytes of $data and returns the
        corresponding ciphertext.

    decrypt($data)
        Decrypts blocksize() bytes of $data and returns the
        corresponding plaintext.

SEE ALSO
    Crypt::CBC, Crypt::Twofish, Crypt::TEA

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Vipul Ved Prakash
        For writing Crypt::GOST 0.41, and reviewing the current
        version.
